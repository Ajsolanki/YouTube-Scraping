0,X9I66fXrGiY,The Boabeng-Fiema Monkey Sanctuary In Ghana,"On our way to Ghana's coast we stopped by the Boabeng-Fiema Monkey Sanctuary. A small village where monkeys and humans live in harmony together. There we encountered Mona and Colobus Monkeys. The Monas were really human friendly and we got super close to them (thanks to a bribe or our two provided by our guide) but the Colobus Monkeys on the other hand weren't really shy but didn't care about humans at all.

In this video you can see us walking around the jungle and village, meeting many, many monkeys. And yes, we also encountered super cute baby monkeys. We hope this video brightens your day. Also check out the monkey cemetery at the end of the video!

The moment you step inside you'll notice instantly that the temperature inside is much cooler than the outside.

Here is the video of Mike actually touching this guy: 



I would also like to draw your attention to the fishing men who decided to walk into the pond right behind the crocodile to throw out his fishing net into the pond. Visiting the crocodile pond was pretty wild. Also don't miss the full article on these wild crocodiles which will published soon on our Ghana Travel Blog:

https://youtu.be/_SaWjJ8G1vs

We're now taking you inside this house built from mud and wood. Also please keep in mind, some of the footage is a bit shaky because some of the passage ways and rooms where tiny and me with my almost 2 meters had a hard time to squeeze through at time.

The moment you step inside you'll notice instantly that the temperature inside is much cooler than the outside. The mud house was built in a way creating this natural air conditioning, letting in cooler air while release hot air. I kind of never wanted to leave the inside again because I knew outside we had to sweat again at 40 plus celsius outside.

We're soon going to write about this the Wulugu Mud House in details on our Ghana Travel Blog:

An entire palace made out of mud and wood and it's built in a way which leads cold air in and hot air out, basically being cooled be a natural air conditioning.

There are so many more interesting facts about the Wulugu Mud House which we will write about it soon on our Ghana Tavel Blog: 



But I want to share one really cool thing about the mud house, the wall surrounding it, is in the shape of Ghana. Don't believe me? Well then see for yourself:

The village was just at the outskirts of Tamale and was surrounded by Shea Nut Trees. We were lucky to see how they're boiling the pressed nuts to separate unwanted particles from the butter. 

That was interesting but even more though we loved watching this old lady spin cotton inside her adobe hut to a thread ,which will be then later be used to produce the traditional cloth item called Smock. 

If you're in Tamale and would love to do the same tour please leave a message int he comments, we can connect you with the people who organized it. All the profits of the tour go directly to the village itself.

We organized a tour to see how shea butter was being made, cotton be spun and drones to be flown. Well, the last craft, I brought into the village 😅!

This village was very close to Tamale and a bit bigger than than the first village we visited. People there were very used to foreigners coming for a visit, since they're part of a program to bring visitors and villagers closer together. Proceeds of these tours go straight to the citizens of this little town.

We love this particular Mascleta because the protective fence is not installed, which gives you a direct view into the plaza, so you can see better what's going on and it also gives you a better sense what a Mascleta is all about.

If you're curious, check out our Valencia Travel Blog, which has tons of information on the Valencian Mascleta: 



Also, I'm sorry about the dust specs on my camera sensor :) I guess I should have cleaned my camera inside and out after our For91days in Ghana. It was a bit dusty there.

Thankfully I know all the little streets to cut through to make it on time and claim a perfect spot between the Plaza del Virgen and the main entrance of the Cathedral, where the virgin figure will be transported to from the Basilica.

It's pretty intense, because it gets very crowded, especially where I was standing. And on top of it, parents are trying to toss toddlers against the Virgin, check out the twins at the end of the video, it's pretty wild!!!

And if you're got some rhythm in your blood you might can join them after the practice :) But we weren't one of them. We walked into the group by chance. We heard some drumming from the main street and followed the sound.

Here is a drone video of the wrong Kukuo: 



But this time we made it to the right village. We knew right away when we got out of the yellow yellow that this was the place to be to see Ghanaian pottery being made. There were two ladies, at first they were very skeptical but after we explained that we were interested in the pottery making process they invited is into their compound and took the time to show us everything. 

Also towards the end of the video, you can't miss that toddler being so tired, falling asleep while I was filming him.

We were just finishing up our tour of the leather factory when we heard music, screams and gun shots. I would like to note at this point that these gunshots were the friendly kind.

People were running to the main street and encouraged us to come along. A small part inside wanted to run the other way BUT any concerns we had were gone once we saw the celebrations. Everyone was happy, dancing and then the new Dakpema / chief of Tamale showed up including his wife, his name is Fuseini Bawa. Things got a bit crazy, heheh. Wo got to see some interesting Northern Ghana rituals.

Sadly the video can't transmit all the interesting smells, was it pleasant, em no. But that's part of the process and we loved watching it. In this video you can see different stages of the leather workshop, not in the right order though but I kept there order in the same way we were shown around.

I was just randomly flying the drone over this neighborhood when I spotted on my screen this procession. Nearby people told us, that today was the day of the celebrations of the new Dakpema of Tamale, WHICH IS A HUGE DEAL! And so rare since it only happens once the previous Chief / Dakpema dies. So I landed my drone right away and we ran over to the main street to watch the people pass buy. Without giving too much away, it was insane.

City Of Arts And Sciences, Valencia","I'm not really in touch what parents do to make raising their kids easier but I've never seen a mom or a dad riding a hoverboard while pushing a stroller. When she zipped by me, I knew I had to do one thing .... get my camera out and start filming. 

So how do you feel about this? Do you think she's genius, lazy, irresponsible or is she even putting her kid into danger. For me it was just such a silly sight, especially since there was another person with her just walking. What was the whole point? Maybe it was because of a medical reason?

So last night in his honor there were firing up one of the vintage fireworks similar to the one we saw last summer: 



The execution wasn't as smooth as the previous firework of that kind we saw but it was still pretty fun.

This was also the first time for me to try out the DJI Osmo Pocket for a firework display. At the end of the video you can hear that the sound was not really good handled by Osmo. I think the problem there was that I had the audio balance set to auto and the camera couldn't really handle the extreme sounds. And I wasn't too happy with the auto exposure pushing up the ISO to very grainy levels. So next time I will film with a set exposure.

Hi guys, in this video I'm going to show you the Hyundai Grand i10. This compact sedan is a popular car to 
rent in Costa Rica and if you plan to rent it as well, I'm going to show you all the key features of this car.

The Hyundai Gran i10 is a compact sedan that is an excellent option for couples, four adults with limited luggage or small families.

This is an economical car to rent, allowing you to see the country on your own schedule, giving you flexibility and convenience while still sticking to a budget.

The Hyundai Gran i10 has a gasoline, 1.25 liters engine, is automatic and it comes with features such as air conditioning, a radio, and a USB to charge your devices or to connect your music.

One of the things I really like the most about about the Hyundai Gran i10 is the trunk size. In this video, I put in one regular size check in and two carry ons but you can see that you are able to fit and rearrange more luggage. 

When I drove this car around, it was very comfortable to drive for a small sedan on paved roads. However, if you do plan to visit more remote areas in Costa Rica, we recommend to look for a bigger model but the Hyundai Gran i10 is excellent for cities, major tourist towns and has great gas efficiency.

I hope this video gives you more insight and information into the Hyundai Gran i10. Don't forget that if you would like to rent this car we have an exclusive car rental discount and extra benefits for our readers. Thanks for watching.",travel

In this video we're going to show you another car you can rent in Costa Rica. This is the Mitsubishi ASX.

The Mitsubishi ASX is a compact SUV that can up to seat 5 passengers and is recommdended for four adults or a young family of five. The trunk space can hold up to two regular sized
check in luggage or one check in bag and two carry ons. This cra also comes with the luggage cover.

The Mitsubishi ASX also comes with a two liter gasoline engine and all the standard features such as air conditioning, radio, CD player, bluetooth and a USB port that you can use for music or to charge your devices.

The car comes with an automatic transmission and is a 4wd. I really like the size of this car. It is an excellent option for those who don't want or need a full size SUV but want something
bigger than a sedan just like me.

We tested the 4wd on some gravel roads, common in rural areas of Costa Rica and it performed really well. As I drove around potholes and on loose rocks I felt very comfortable and secure
as I was driving towards one of the my favorite beaches in Costa Rica.

I hope this video gives you guys more information and insight into the Mitsubishi ASX. If you guys want to rent this car for your Costa Rica vacation, don't forget we have an exclusive car rental discount and extra benefits just for our readers, thanks for watching.",travel

Another activity that they offer is an easy 1 kilometer walk. It's a great way to also see nature and wildlife. 

Today is our last day here in Tortuguero and we're actually about to go take the boat back to La Pavona to head back to San Jose. We had a great time here in Tortuguero and Pachira Lodge. We saw a ton of wildlife and enjoyed a lot of the nature that's around. 

Pachira makes it really easy to visit Tortuguero, as they include everything from transportation to food to activities and they have packages from one day to two or three or four or however how long you want to stay.

We are at the Bogarin Trail in La Fortuna town where we're going to look for some birds and hopefully see some sloths. So this is a great option if you guys want to see some sloths, it's not a very long trail, you guys will see what it's like in the video and I hope you enjoy.

A pretty good place we can be able to find the two different species of sloths we have in Costa Rica, the two toed and the three toed which is something really cool too because in some parts of the country you can just see one of the two species but right here we have both of them, the two and the three toed.   

We just finished the trail and it was really cool. We saw five different sloths, toucans, a lot of different birds, lizards, iguanas and even frogs.

Today we're taking the ferry from Puntarenas to Paquera and we're actually at the ticket office in Puntarenas so this is at the end of the road, the main road that goes through Puntarenas and it's called Paseo de los Turistas.

So you'll drive all the way past the lighthouse and then you will see the ferry on your left hand side and right across is the ticket office, you can't miss it, it's a big blue sign over here so we're going to go buy our tickets first and you should do it at least an hour before, especially if you have a car because you have to wait, you have to drive onto the waiting area and it's first come first serve, it gets very busy during high season. So we're going to go buy our tickets for the 2 pm ferry so we'll show you guys the schedule and we'll show you the process of how to get on the ferry with your car and there's also a walkway if you don't have a car and you're just riding the ferry as a passenger.

This is the schedule for the ferry, this is the Puntarenas one we're going to take and we're going to take the 2 pm ferry and this is the other side, the Paquera to Puntarenas. Here are the rates so you have per person and you have per car, motorcycle, bike, etc.

We just bought our tickets for the ferry and they look like this, we have a car, this one is for the car and this price actually has the driver included and this one is for me who is the passenger. So one adult is 810 colones, a car with a driver is, oh they actually put 11, 400 for the car and 810 for the driver on here so you need to hold onto these when you get onto the ferry and throughout the whole ferry ride because they might ask you for it so now we're going to go onto the car and they'll announce when they start loading the cars on so we're going to go over there and get ready to drive on the ferry.

So we're inside the ferry, you can see they have seats inside, there's AC, TV's, they have a snack area behind me, a bar, water, a bathroom as well, it's about an hour ferry ride. It's very nice and you can sit outside and on top to enjoy the view and enjoy the ferry ride.

We have made it to Paquera, as you can see the ferry was really easy to take, it was a very nice ride. This is a good way to go from San Jose over if you want to go to Montezuma or Santa Teresa, Tambor, all those areas. 

So if you guys want to learn more about taking the ferry, I'm going to put more information and pictures in the post so click on the links below and I hope you found this video useful.",travel

TRANSCRIPT

Hey guys, today we are the Diamante Eco Adventure Park in Gulf of Papagayo, Guanacaste, Costa Rica. I am with Julian, who is one of the owners of the park and he's going to share us some more information about it.

So Julian first, thank you so much for having us. Can you share with us more about Diamante and the kind of activities there are to do here? 

OK well I think you did the Adventure Pass today right? Yes! Did you have fun? Yes, loved it. OK well the reason why the reason the Adventure Pass is our most widely used pass is that you do everything in the park for one price. And you start off with our zipline which is really amazing. It's five lines but you get the most ride time in the entire country. The reason why people really love our lines is that in most traditional ziplines, you have to put your hand on the line to slow yourself down or even stop but at Diamante all of our lines are completely automatic braking so it allows you to sit back and really have a good time and experience some amazing views that we have around the park. 

Our biggest line is one of the top five in the world, you fly for almost a mile in a superman style and it's absolutely one of the best ziplines you'll do in your life. 

We did the zipline and I can definitely attest to that, it was amazing. So what other activities are in the Adventure Pass?

So when you finish the Adventure Pass on our zipline, you end up in our animal sanctuary and it's the largest animal sanctuary in the country. All the animals in there have been donated to us from MINAE, which is the Costa Rican equivalent to our wildlife organization and we have everything from jaguars to pumas, ocelots, margays, a lot of cats, also crocodiles and we have even have an incredible butterfly sanctuary. I didn't think I would ever say incredible butterfly sanctuary but it's really cool to walk through and see all the different butterflies, it's a really serene setting.

And tell me more about Lucy. Lucy, our number one most requested person to see here is Lucy the sloth and she's in an outdoor area and you can cruise by. We have certain feeding times that are promoted throughout the day so you can really get an upclose viewing of Lucy while she has her breakfast or lunch and there's plenty of time to see here because she moves really slow and eats even slower.

Alright so after the animal sanctuary, there's a couple of other activities in the Adventure pass correct? Yes, once you finish the sanctuary, you can head down to the beach. We're the only ocean front adventure park in the country so you can walk down to the beach and you can enjoy stand up paddle boards, kayaks, snorkeling, whatever you want to do on the ocean side, you can do it there. There's hammocks there if you want to take a nap, if you're too tired from  all the other fun you have. You can also walk through our botanical garden and you can end up in our ocean view welcome center which has an amazing buffet every day.

Thank you so much Julian for sharing this information, you guys have to come in and enjoy the superman zipline, it's incredible. Not only are the views amazing but I also felt incredibly safe, what's really special is that the harnesses are really comfortable and the wires are carbon fiber so it's so quiet and you can enjoy the ocean view the entire time.

I hope you guys enjoy the video, please click on the links below to learn more and hope to see you guys here one day!",travel

168,LgE5H7drGI0,Pakistan Atom Bomb Test | How Pakistan Become Atomic Power,"It is a day when nuclear explosions were made Pakistan unbelievable. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was in Almaty, Kazakhstan, on 11 May 1998 when India took nuclear bomb in Pokhran. The Prime Minister telephoned Army Chief General Jehangir Karama from there and said that prepare for nuclear explosions to respond to India. General Jehangir Karamatik was a sailor, he suggested that no decision would be made in the hurry, after taking any step after considering all the negative and positive aspects of this decision on your return, it would be better. Nawaz Sharif shortened his visit and returned to Pakistan and May 13 was convened as the Cabinet Defense Committee. The three services chiefs attended this meeting. Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs Gohar Ayub, Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz and Federal Interior Minister Chaudhry Shujat Hussain besides Dr Abdul Qadir Khan and Dr. Samar Mubarakhi from the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, attended the meeting. Dr. Ashfaq Ahmed, chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, was in America in those days who were immediately told to return home. The Prime Minister did not allow the Secretary Finance to call it, but Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz was asked to give the opinion on the situation. Sartaj Aziz was not in favor of nuclear explosions and he believed that instead of nuclear bomb, the economic package and national security protection should be guaranteed.   claimed that Army Chief General Jehangir Karamat and Naval Chief Admiral Fascin Bukhari opposed the nuclear explosions, while Air Marshal Parvez, head of the Pure Air Force Mahdi Qureshi said in favor of nuclear bomb. During the meeting, the participants, according to their understanding, believed that the sincerely opinion was not based on any bad, but they were supporting or opposing the interests of the foreign interests. General Jehangir Karamas defended his stand in Shuja Nawaz's book ""Cross Swords"", saying he did not want any decision in the hurry. General Jahangir Karamat says that nuclear bombings would be restricted under American laws, but they wanted to know that after the nuclear bomb, due to any obstacle in the budget, the forces did not reduce the operational capacity of Pakistan. Come, especially Kashmir is not affected. We made these assurances and that's what we wanted.

On the next day, May 14, a federal cabinet meeting was held as if it was surrounded by ""peace flights"" around Nawaz Sharif. Sartaj Aziz, who was the finance minister, described his book in Bet stressed that instead of facing global pressure by using a nuclear bomb, India should be lonely on diplomatic level and should accept the economic package for non-nuclear bombings. Regarding the remaining 6 ministers, Sartaj Aziz believes neither Hawk nor can be called Dove. For this, Sartaj Aziz has used the term Hoves, which means he was neither in three nor thirteen. At that time, Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub exposed his book Glimpses into the 'imperialties' in the corridors of powers. They claim that Sartaj Aziz was not the only, Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, Begum Abid Hussain and Mushahid Hussein Syed were also opposed to nuclear explosions. However, after the discussion, the option of decision was given to the prime minister. The situation was now that on one side the incredible attitude was being taken by the Indian leadership, L. Advani and Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee had threatened to destroy the bomb, and on the other hand, global pressures were increasing to stop nuclear bombings. . US President Bill Clinton told Nawaz Sharif five times to not make a nuclear bomb and offered a $ 5 billion economic and military aid. It was not easy to settle this offer because Pakistan was financially troubled economically. In the case of nuclear explosions, not just economic sanctions, but the bill of $ 2 billion meeting with IMF would be canceled, which would worsen the situation. US President sent Deputy Foreign Minister Strobe Talboot to Pakistan to brief the possible results of nuclear explosions, who confessed in his book Engaging India that the government of Pakistan refused to accept any kind of pressure and said clearly Given that there is no option except to answer India's nuclear explosions. On May 18, 1998, Dr. Ashfaq Ahmed, head of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, was given a green signal for nuclear explosions. On May 28, 1998, three o'clock took place in the past sixteen, in the sixteen minutes, he became the father of the Chagai mountains and became the nuclear power of Pakistan.

173,BqdmMEE-U8U,What Would Happen If Rogue Planet Enter Our Solar System | Kya Qayamat Kareeb A Gayi Ha? |Urdu Hindi,"Very Informative And Knowledge Video..
A rogue planet  is a planetary-mass object that orbits a galactic center directly. Such objects have been ejected from the planetary system in which they formed or have never been gravitationally bound to any star or brown dwarf. The Milky Way alone may have billions of rogue planets.

Some planetary-mass objects may have formed in a similar way to stars
There is a very strange object floating around our stellar neighbourhood and it has astronomers intrigued.

The object, about a dozen times more massive than Jupiter, is a surprisingly strong magnetic powerhouse and a ""rogue,"" traveling through space unaccompanied by any parent star.

At just 20 light years from home, this marks the first planetary-mass object that has ever been detected using radio telescopy. 

At 12.7 times more bigger than Jupiter, travelling with speed of hundred of kilometers per second.
 It also has a strong magnetic field that is more than 200 times stronger than Jupiter's.

The temperature on its surface is more than 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit. Although this sounds hot, it's quite cool compared with the sun's surface temperature of about 9,932 degrees Fahrenheit.

175,46WuAUpzg0,History And Reality of Valentine's Day | Valentine Day Exposed | Urdu Hindi,"Valentine's Day, also called Saint Valentine's Day or the Feast of Saint Valentine,[1] is a secular and religious holiday celebrated annually on February 14. It originated as a Western Christian feast day honoring one or two early saints named Valentinus. Valentine's Day is recognized as a significant cultural, religious, and commercial celebration of romance and romantic love in many regions around the world, although it is not a public holiday in any country.

There are numerous martyrdom stories associated with various Valentines connected to February 14,[2] including a written account of Saint Valentine of Rome's imprisonment for performing weddings for soldiers who were forbidden to marry and for ministering to Christians persecuted under the Roman Empire.[3]


From Feb. 13 to 15, the Romans celebrated the feast of Lupercalia. The men sacrificed a goat and a dog, then whipped women with the hides of the animals they had just slain. Young women would actually line up for the men to hit them, Lenski says. They believed this would make them fertile.

The brutal fete included a matchmaking lottery, in which young men drew the names of women from a jar. The couple would then be, um, coupled up for the duration of the festival — or longer, if the match was right.

The ancient Romans may also be responsible for the name of our modern day of love. Emperor Claudius II executed two men — both named Valentine — on Feb. 14 of different years in the 3rd century A.D. Their martyrdom was honored by the Catholic Church with the celebration of St. Valentine's Day.
It is very important in Islam for a believer to ensure that there is no contradiction between their outward actions and their innate beliefs and faith.

Therefore, whether a Muslim is alone or in the public eye, they strive to unequivocally obey their Lord, Allah, by following His messenger, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), at all times.

Islam is not merely a set of physical worship rituals, though these are important in their own right.

It is also a set of guidelines, responsibilities towards others, and rights, which impacts a Muslim’s social customs, interactions, and obligations.

Allah has commanded Muslims to remain united, keep close community bonds with each other to form a strong, global brotherhood, and to not follow the ways of the disbelievers.

Hence, the conscientious Muslim is not a slave to passing trends and customs that have no basis in Islam.

Instead of thinking -why not? what’s the harm?- before following the crowd and their seasonal whims; a Muslim thinks- should I? Will Allah be pleased with this?

The Prophet said: 

Whoever imitates a people is one of them. (Abu Dawud)

Consequently, Muslims do not celebrate any days, festivals, or seasonal celebrations that were not celebrated by the Prophet and his companions.

Valentine in History & Today
Furthermore, Valentine’s Day is a celebration that has no basis in anything worthwhile or noble.

Its origin lies in Roman history, purportedly connected to a “saint” called “Valentine”, who was sentenced to death on 14th February 270 CE.

It began as a pagan ritual started by Romans in the 4th century BC to honor their false god Lupercus.

The main attraction of this ritual was a lottery held to distribute young women to young men for “entertainment and pleasure” — until the next year’s lottery..

In this way, Valentine’s Day promotes adultery and promiscuous relationships, which undermine and jeopardize the sanctity of marriage and the stability of the family unit.

It leads to unnecessary expenditure, and promotes fornication, drinking, and immorality.

Lastly, this day compounds a sense of deprivation, loneliness, and low self-worth among those people who are single.

Islam prohibits dating and sex outside marriage, both of which Valentine’s Day encourages.

It is obvious, then, that a Muslim should not celebrate it.

Love in Islam
On the other hand, Islam encourages strong bonds of love, community, and brotherhood and sisterhood among Muslims, and families, and does not restrict the expression of this brotherly, sisterly, martial, or familial love to just one day a year.

Giving gifts has also been encouraged in Islam, and once again, not restricted to just one day.

Businesses, on the other hand, capitalize on this day to earn as much revenue as possible by offering customized products and services..

176,ij2DaPHRdfQ,History of Battle of Maritsa | History of Ottoman Empire(Sultanat e Usmania) | Urdu Hindi,"Battle of the Maritsa River, (September 26, 1371), Ottoman Turk victory over Serbian forces that allowed the Turks to extend their control over southern Serbia and Macedonia. After the Ottoman sultan Murad I (reigned 1360–89) advanced into Thrace, conquered Adrianople, and thereby gained control of the Maritsa River valley, which led into the central Balkans, the Christian states of the Balkans formed an alliance to drive him back. 
The Battle of Maritsa, or took place at the Maritsa River near the village of Chernomen (today Ormenio in Greece) on September 27, 1371 between the forces of Ottoman commanders Lala Shahin Pasha and Evrenos and Serbian commanders King Vukašin Mrnjavčević and his brother Despot Jovan Uglješa who also wanted to get revenge after the First Battle of Maritsa.Their early efforts ended in defeat, and the Bulgarians were compelled to become vassals of the sultan (1366). Another campaign to resist Turkish expansion was organized in 1371 by Vukašin, the king of the southern Serbian lands, who gathered an army 

The Serbian forces ranged from between 20,000-70,000. 
The Ottomans range 800-1000.

What is the reason for such an incredible victory? 
The Serbians had made their camp near the Maritsa. They decided to celebrate their future victory and held a feast. By the morning, the camp largely unguarded and many of the men were drunk.

The force of the Ottoman leader Lala Shahin entered the camp in the morning. His men took their knives out and began slaughtering their sleeping enemies. In the Massacre that followed the two Serbian leaders were killed. Whoever did not die from the Ottoman blades drowned in the river of Maritsa, in an attempt to escape. After the battle, the Maritsa ran scarlet with blood.
The battle involved such carnage that the field was later referred to as “the Serbs’ destruction.” It confirmed Bulgaria’s status as a vassal-state to the Turks and destroyed the independent South Serbian kingdom, whose new ruler, Marko Kraljević, became a vassal of the sultan.

Battle of maritsa is also one of the Muslim bravery story like Battle of Badr, Battle ofmutah, Battle of hattin which no one  have ever told you.
The ottoman sultan proved to be like his forefathers Ertugul, Osman.

""Indistractable provides a framework that will deliver the focus you need to get results.""
- James Clear, author of Atomic Habits

You sit down at your desk to work on an important project, but a notification on your phone interrupts your morning. Later, as you're about to get back to work, a colleague taps you on the shoulder to chat. At home, screens get in the way of quality time with your family. Another day goes by, and once again, your most important personal and professional goals are put on hold.

What would be possible if you followed through on your best intentions? What could you accomplish if you could stay focused and overcome distractions? What if you had the power to become ""indistractable?""

International bestselling author, former Stanford lecturer, and behavioral design expert, Nir Eyal, wrote Silicon Valley's handbook for making technology habit-forming. Five years after publishing Hooked, Eyal reveals distraction's Achilles' heel in his groundbreaking new book.

In Indistractable, Eyal reveals the hidden psychology driving us to distraction. He describes why solving the problem is not as simple as swearing off our devices: Abstinence is impractical and often makes us want more.

Eyal lays bare the secret of finally doing what you say you will do with a four-step, research-backed model. Indistractable reveals the key to getting the best out of technology, without letting it get the best of us.

Inside, Eyal overturns conventional wisdom and reveals:
Why distraction at work is a symptom of a dysfunctional company culture--and how to fix it

- What really drives human behavior and why ""time management is pain management""

- Why your relationships (and your sex life) depend on you becoming indistractable

- How to raise indistractable children in an increasingly distracting world

Empowering and optimistic, Indistractable provides practical, novel techniques to control your time and attention--helping you live the life you really want.",science

Distraction certainly has a price. &nbsp;Nonetheless, we love our distractions! Social media, spectator sports, movies, books, TV shows, the news, video games – what would we do without them?

 Clearly, there are benefits to distractions as evidenced by the fact that nearly everyone on earth seeks them out. But why? Although they seem to pull us away from more important things, what purpose do they serve? And, when at times

 Our brains have a&nbsp;limited ability to focus. We can’t pay attention to everything around us all at once so we must choose what to focus on. For example, we may choose to focus on work while struggling to resist more interesting distractions.

 &nbsp;As part of a French study, researchers wanted to know if they could influence how much money people handed to a total stranger using just a few specially encoded words. They discovered a technique so simple and effective&nbsp;it doubled the amount people gave.

 The turn of phrase has been shown to not only increase how much bus fare people give, but was also effective in boosting charitable donations and participation in voluntary surveys. In fact, a recent&nbsp;meta-analysis&nbsp;of 42 studies involving over 22,000 participants concluded that these few words, placed at the end of a request, are a highly-effective way to gain compliance, doubling the likelihood of people saying “yes.”

Paulette writes about finances, psychology, technology, travel, and better living for the likes of&nbsp;The New York Times,&nbsp;Elle, and&nbsp;Slate.

 I learned how to respect authority from my father. At the top of a huge water slide at a theme park, he put me, my siblings and cousins in a huge, round raft, then started to get in himself. “No sir, that’s too many,” said the attendant. My father simply replied, “Hup, too late!” Then jumped in and shoved off. We caught air on the bumps, making the ride much more wild than it would have been, had we followed the rules.

 Dodging the regulations of anyone with a whistle or a name tag became my favorite game. I avoided homework in sixth grade and, when I had a solid 0 percent in the class at midterm and my parents grounded me for six weeks, I filibustered my way out of my punishment by the second weekend. For years at school, I did the least amount of work possible, then crammed for tests. In high school, I had the best fake ID.

Snapchat, the messaging app known for helping teenagers sext one another,&nbsp;reportedly received&nbsp;a $10 billion valuation from its investors. Has the world gone mad?

194,XHW5m1tgPMA,How to Use Psychology to Make Persuasive Video-Nir&Far-Episode#48,"Compared to other media types on the web, video is unique in the immediacy with which it can convey a vast amount of emotional and informational content to its viewers. By virtue of the fact that video is an instantaneous form of communication, it has the advantage of being able to create a shared experience, in which people can watch the same thing at the same time, wherever in the world they might be. As with all social content, enabling people to participate in such a way can create a profound sense of connection and community, which can help generate word of mouth and amplify the reach of your message.

 Unlike images or copy, video (and audio) set the pace at which a story or message is delivered. Although it is true that people can stop watching whenever they choose, the analytics tools built into video hosting platforms are making it easier than ever before to assess when people are bouncing away. This means that you can track exactly how far individuals get through a piece of content before they stop consuming it, which may help infer why the video isn’t engaging its viewers as expected. This can then inform the process by which you optimise your media, making video one of the most trackable forms of web content, as well as one of the most emotive.

 When used onsite, videos can also help boost conversion rates, both in general and when used to showcase specific products or services. A&nbsp;private study&nbsp;exploring customer behaviors on electrical goods website&nbsp;ao.com, found that those who watched a product video were 100 per cent more likely to convert, spending an average of 9.1 per cent more than those who didn’t.&nbsp;In&nbsp;another study, customers who watched videos (of all kinds, not just those of products) on&nbsp;wistia.com&nbsp;were found to be 63 percent more likely on average to convert.

199,Lar5qSSW,Infinite Scroll: The Web’s Slot Machine-Nir&Far-Episode#43,"A few years ago, everyone was clicking. Today, we’re all scrolling. Twitter, Pinterest, Facebook,&nbsp;Instagram, and&nbsp;Medium&nbsp;– it seems everyone is getting on the infinite scroll bus. What is it about this magical design pattern that has so many consumer web companies using it?

 Not too long ago, users were forced to reload pages to progress from one piece of content to the next. Web designers were advised against creating websites with information appearing “below the fold”, the portion of the page underneath what is displayed on the screen. As mobile phones and tablets gained wider adoption, it looked like the swipe might become standard fare. But that’s all changed now. Today, designers are&nbsp;dumping the click and flick and opting for the scroll for one simple reason – it works.

 The infinite scroll is interaction design’s answer to our penchant for endlessly searching for novelty. Certainly, there are technical reasons for the scroll’s increasing ubiquity. The rise of dynamic content, like a new comment entering the feed, necessitated a better solution than pagination built for static content. But to really understand why the scroll works so well requires a brief trip inside the mind and back in time.

How is it that these companies, producing little more than bits of code displayed on a screen, can seemingly control users’ minds? Why are these sites so addictive and what does their power mean for the future of the web?

 We’re on the precipice of a&nbsp;new era&nbsp;of the web. As infinite distractions compete for our attention, companies are learning to master new tactics&nbsp;to stay relevant in users’ minds and lives. Today, just amassing millions of users is&nbsp;no longer good enough. Companies increasingly find that their economic value is a function of the strength of the habits they create. But as some companies are just waking up to this new reality, others are already cashing in.

201,4OLJb4sUMOQ,Hooking Users In 3 Steps: An Intro to Habit Testing-Nir&Far-Episode#41,"The truly great consumer technology companies of the past 25 years have all had one thing in common: they created habits. This is what separates world-changing businesses from the rest. Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Twitter are used daily by a high proportion of their users and their products are so compelling that many of us struggle to imagine life before they existed.

 But creating habits is easier said than done.&nbsp;Though I’ve written extensively about&nbsp;behavior engineering&nbsp;and theimportance of habits&nbsp;to the&nbsp;future of the web, few resources give entrepreneurs the tools they need to design and measure user habits. It’s not that these techniques don’t exist — in fact, they’re quite familiar to people in all the companies named above. However, to the new entrepreneur, they largely remain a mystery.

 I’ve learned these methods from some of the best in the business and put together an amalgamation of them that I call “Habit Testing.” It can be used by consumer web companies to build products that users not only love, but are hooked to.

The Internet has become a giant hairball of choice-inhibiting noise and the need to make sense of it all has never been more acute.

 Just ask high-flying sites like Pinterest, Reddit, and Tumblr. These&nbsp;curated web&nbsp;portals connect millions of people to information they never knew they were looking for. Some have started monetizing this tremendous flow of traffic and though it’s too early to call winners and losers,&nbsp;their strategy of driving user engagement by creating daily habits is clear. These companies are following a plan implemented by web titans like Amazon and Google and are hoping to yield similar results.

 Creating user habits leverages two critical factors that should be considered by every company attempting to build high-engagement products.

 Smelling an opportunity, investors just&nbsp;plowed&nbsp;$120 million into the company, giving it a $1.12 billion valuation.

 “Our subscription revenue is growing about 8 percent monthly, before we add new sales,” says Slack’s business analytics lead&nbsp;Josh Pritchard. “This is, as far as I know, unheard for an enterprise SaaS company less than seven months after launch.”

His screen is an explosion of urgent files — a master control center for managing clandestine operatives. The man of mystery persona is typified by a side-sliding sports car winding through an onslaught of Word docs and Jpeg files. Just looking at his desktop can raise your blood pressure.

 But Van Els is not a secret agent. He’s a mess.

 In fact, Van Els’ LinkedIn profile says he is in the “custom made earplugs” business. Apparently, there is no correlation between the mayhem on one’s laptop and the adventure in one’s life. Anyone can find themselves drowning in desktop clutter and research suggests this digital detritus costs us time, degrades performance, and kills concentration.

Let me know what you think in the comments.

 Over the past four years, I’ve discovered many incredible ways to hack my habits, set better goals, and improve my life. I have taught myself to love running, dramatically improved my diet and found the focus to write a&nbsp;bestselling book. Understanding how the mind works and using it to affect my daily behaviors has yielded tremendous dividends.

 However, there is one goal that’s nagged at me for years that despite my best efforts, I’ve never been able to achieve — going to the gym consistently. I hate lifting weights. Hate it. I disdain the strain, the sweat, the smells — all of it. The only thing I like about working out are the results. Unfortunately, there’s no way to enjoy the benefits of going to the gym without, you know, actually going to the gym.

We knew nearly no one but were sure we’d soon find a fun-loving group like the 20- and 30-something New Yorkers who spontaneously dropped in on one another on TV shows like&nbsp;Seinfeld&nbsp;and&nbsp;Friends.

 We hatched a plan. After moving into our Midtown Manhattan apartment, we invited all the neighbors over for drinks by placing Kinko’s-printed quarter-sheets into everyone’s mailboxes. Then, we waited for our versions of Chandler, Kramer, and Elaine to show up. But they didn’t. In fact, no one did. As the ice in the cooler melted and the guacamole browned, not a single person among 100 apartments stopped by. Not. One. Person.

 Recalling that episode now, we sound embarrassingly naïve. We didn’t realize friendships in the real world worked nothing like the ones we had forged in our dormitories, let alone those we saw on television. Yet as it turns out, our desire to belong to a tight community was far from foolish.

 Being different, the notion goes, is the route to success. Think different was even Apple’s motto for a period. And Apple is often held up as a poster child of the benefits of this ethos. Conventional wisdom suggests that products like the iPhone and Macintosh succeeded because they were different from the rest. Steve Jobs was a visionary because he thought different from everyone else.&nbsp;

 There’s only one problem with this advice. It’s wrong.

 On March 27, 1964, Kitty Genovese was brutally attacked and killed in the open streets of New York City. What makes Genovese’s story so tragic is that police later discovered numerous people were aware of Genovese’s distress but never came to her aid. Though the total number of witnesses is disputed, the story stands as an example of the&nbsp;bystander effect, the psychological phenomenon where people are less likely to assist if they know others are around.

 But there’s good news. A 2011 research study showed that the bystander effect can actually be&nbsp;reversed.&nbsp;While it’s unlikely you’ll witness a murder, the bystander effect can occur online as well as off. Understanding how to get people to help one another is important for anyone building an online community.

 Let’s take a closer look at why the bystander effect occurs and the critical research that shows how to reverse it.

 Today, making machines and humans indistinguishable from each other is no longer science fiction, it’s good business.

The study at hand identifies and tests explanatory factors influencing the success of scientific crowdfunding projects by drawing on news value theory, the “reputation signaling” approach, and economic theories of online payment. 
A standardized content analysis of 371 projects on English- and German-language platforms reveals that each theory provides factors influencing crowdfunding success. 
It shows that projects presented on science-only crowdfunding platforms have a higher success rate. At the same time, projects are more likely to be successful if their presentation includes visualizations and humor, the lower their targeted funding is, the less personal data potential donors have to relinquish and the more interaction between researchers and donors is possible. This suggests that after donors decide to visit a scientific crowdfunding platform, factors unrelated to science matter more for subsequent funding decisions, raising questions about the potential and implications of crowdfunding science

Published in Public Understanding of Science, April 2016

In this article, we study the evolution of opinion genres regarding climate change in three Spanish newspapers (El País, El Mundo, and ABC). Analyzing the op-ed articles in these newspapers, we observe a significant change in the evolution of opinion. While denialism was very present in conservative press in 2007, 7 years later it is almost absent from El Mundo, and its presence in ABC is much lower and inactive: this shows that scientific consensus has prevailed over time and Spanish denialism has weakened, exclusively supported by political arguments by the most conservative parties.",science

Kirschstreusel is a German household sugar pie. It's quick and easy. You can use any sour fruits as the filling. It takes no time to fix a streusel and they taste heavenly. 

Allgäuer Kirschkuchen is more of a regional dessert. Germans like to make a great fuss when people take Bayern as the German stereotype. The Allgäu is a region in Swabia in southern Germany which is much larger than the definition of Bavaria. Allgäuer Kirschkuchen is a much more sophisticated creation, but also time-consuming.

Choose a piece of lamb with bones, here I'm cooking a lamb cutlet. Cut the lamb flesh against the grain, otherwise, it would be harder to chow. The rice noodles should be consumed right after cooking since they could go bad quickly. Remove the forams on the surface at the beginning while boiling the broth so it will turn white and rich at the end.

325,MLkGbWftR7M,,"Unquestionably, strawberry is one of my favourite fruits. Their light fragrant and sweet taste go great with dessert baking. Fresh strawberries can be used in cakes, tarts, pancakes, ice cream and a lot more. While they are in season now, it's the perfect timing to have a good use of them for some my delicious baking recipes. 

This strawberry tart with marzipan cream is very light and refreshing. It can be served cold or at room temperature. The crust is so crispy, the filling is so nutty and creamy, a perfect balance with fresh strawberries.

327,3lnJJ6Ap1tA,German nut wedge/ Nussecken German recipe #40 德國堅果角,"German nut wedge/ Nussecken, a good & old German dessert. I never really paid attention to them, because of their ordinary appearance. There is definitely a reason why they happen to be in almost all German bakeries and people just love them here, especially kids. They are simply delicious. 

They're sweet and nutty. The rich dark chocolate and sour apricot jam can balance the sweetness from the shortbread and caramelized nut layer perfectly.

328,Llq4UFkKZZ8,German sausage salad Wurstsalat German recipe #39 德國火腿沙拉,"German sausage salad Wurstsalat German recipe, a quick and easy traditional German salad. It's also one of my new favourites. I like the combination of tart sausage, onion and pickle and the slightly sweet salad dressing. 

There are many veggies can be added to the salad, such as radish, spring onion or even coriander.  (except most of Germans hate coriander.)

We just came back from a short holiday in Egypt. You will definitely see more videos on my channel.

329,nihgnTIbJ8,Warm chocolate cake with berry sauce for Easter 巧克力蛋糕加树莓汁,"Warm chocolate cake with berry sauce, I found this recipe from a Provence cookbook. It was an instant attraction. The look of it just irresistible. Because of that, I made it once for my in-laws and a couple of more times later. I just enjoyed the combination of sweet and sour berry sauce and the soft chocolate cake. 

It should be hard on the outside but fluid on the inside. Unfortunately, I left it in the oven for too long in this video and the cake turned out to be slightly overdone. 

This is a recipe for 6 portions.

They are crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The classic ones I had in my childhood were made with beef. Here is a tasty variation from Chengdu Szechuan. 

They were one of my favourite breakfast options in the morning markets. 

Here are some tips for you to make these authentic fried dumplings: 

Fresh pork mince makes the filling extra tender.  
The free-range chicken gives you a rich chicken broth. 
Cill the filling in the fridge for a couple of hours before wrapping them.

331,i1SmQfWnqwU,Mini-Berliner with raspberry jam/ jelly donuts German recipe #38 德國甜甜圈,"Mini-Berliner with raspberry jam/ jelly donuts, a classic German bake good, a must-have during this German carnival season. Although they look ordinary but can be quite tricky to make. 

My tip here is to give the dough enough time to rest to get the optimal fluffy texture and fry them on very low heat to prevent our Berliners from burning on the outside, but still raw on the inside.

LIPS 3D Depth Sensing Camera can measure the dimension of an object with its X, Y parameters and also Z parameter, that is the depth. For example, when the camera is sensing a box, with the middleware software developed by LIPS, we can easily get the information, like the number of boxes, and its length, width and height.

This technology can be applied in logistics, convenient store, and even airport to efficiently measure the parcel and luggage.  
   
Besides, the camera can be applied to people counting and facial recognition. For example, you can install the 3D camera at the access-control entrance in a factory, you may no longer check in with your colleague’s ID card or use employee’s photo to pass the access-control entrance.

436,91b13tXaoJ8,Employee Background Checks,"Employers, including manufacturers throughout Southern California, today are faced with a number of employee-related exposures that include falsified credentials, embezzlement, workplace violence and lawsuits that result from bad hiring decisions. To improve their risk profile, many manufacturers contract out/conduct employee background checks as part of their hiring process. It’s important that when requesting/performing background checks that, as an employer, you understand the national standards as set by the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) as well as California state law.

Under the FCRA, national standards apply when an employment background check is prepared by an outside screening company that you hire. When a third party compiles a report, the FCRA requires:

(1) that an potential employee is notified that an investigation may be performed

(2) that the employee is given the opportunity to consent, and

(3) that the employee is notified if information in the report is used to make an “adverse” decision.

With regard to this last point, for job applicants, an “adverse action” means an employer has decided not to hire the individual based on the information in the report. For existing employees, an adverse action might mean termination, or it could be a decision to not promote the individual or to demote him or her. The individual must also receive a second notice after an adverse action, providing information on how to dispute inaccurate or incomplete information. In addition, specific permission from the individual must be obtained if medical information is requested.

California Law – Background Checks

Under FCRA and California law, you must obtain written authorization from a job applicant and employees before beginning the investigation process through a screening agency. Also, as with the FCRA, California law requires specific authorization from the individual if information about his or her medical history or condition will be obtained. There are certain differences as well.

First, in California, an employment background check is called an “investigative consumer report” (ICR). While these reports under the FCRA are limited to personal interviews with friends, neighbors or business associates, in California, an ICR covers an individual’s “character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living” obtained through “any means.” Moreover, a job applicant in California or current employee receives a more extensive notice than the one required under the FCRA. In California, before a background check is conducted by an outside screening company, an individual will receive a notice that:


-    States the purpose of the report.
-    Provides the name, address, and telephone number of the screening company.
-    Includes a summary of the employee’s rights to see and copy any report about him or her
-    Includes a box to check if the employee wants a copy of the employee report.

Additional Considerations

Along with these federal guidelines, there are a growing number of state laws that restrict or prohibit the use of criminal background checks specifically. The most aggressive of these laws is called “ban the box” and prohibits employers from asking about potential employees’ conviction records. There are a total of 24 states representing nearly every region of the country that have adopted the “ban the box” policy including California. The “ban the box” laws typically do not prevent a company from ever asking about a candidate’s criminal history during the hiring process. Rather, they seek to move the question out of the job application stage in hopes of avoiding discrimination.

As you can see, compliance with employment background checks is complex and involves understanding both federal and state law. Non-compliance can land your manufacturing firm in litigation for an employment practices violation. Precision Manufacturing Insurance Services (PMIS) specializes in safeguarding the manufacturing industry throughout California with comprehensive insurance programs, including Employment Practices Liability Insurance (EPLI), as well as HR services that include hiring best practices and the development of a strong employee handbook. To learn more about our products and services and how we can assist you in mitigating potential employee-related claims and other risks, contact us at 855.910.5788.",manufacturing
437,HlLoRpojHJA,The Important Employee Handbook,"During the last several years, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has undertaken a proactive stance to go after companies that are potentially in violation of employment laws. This includes investigating allegations involving non-compliance with the Americans with Disability Act (ADA), pursuing efforts to protect transgender rights, increasing the agency’s efforts to litigate pregnancy discrimination cases, taking on wage-hour disputes, and establishing the EEOC Strategic Enforcement Plan (SEP) for fiscal years 2013-2016. The SEP’s purpose, according to the EEOC, is to focus and coordinate the agency’s programs to reduce and deter discriminatory practices in the workplace. Priorities under SEP include eliminating barriers in recruiting and hiring; protecting immigrant, migrant and other vulnerable workers; addressing emerging issues; enforcing equal pay laws; and deterring harassment in the workplace, among others.

In addition to EEOC regulations, employers in California face state labor laws that are among the toughest in the country. For example, in 2015, several laws went into effect including the California Healthy Workplaces, Healthy Families Act of 2014, which requires most employers to allow employees to accrue up to three days of paid sick leave per year based on an accrual of at least one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked. The law applies to all employers that have at least one employee who works more than 30 days in a year in the state of California. Also in effect, as of 2015, was the inclusion of information on abusive conduct in mandatory sexual harassment training for employers with at least 50 employees.

Moreover, effective this year, the California labor commissioner’s power was expanded to allow for the collection of back wages and penalties from employers that fail to pay minimum wages and overtime, force employees to work off the clock, refuse to offer meal and rest breaks, or make illegal paycheck deductions. Employers can now be subject to stop-work orders, levies against their bank accounts and liens against their property. Employers, as well as owners, directors or managing agents acting on behalf of an employer, can be subject to criminal and personal liability. Also in 2016, amendments to the California Equal Pay Act went into effect, which prohibits gender-based wage differentials. This amendment makes it easier for current and former employees to allege payment of wage rates less than those paid to employees of the opposite sex, and changes the standard from equal pay for equal “skill, effort and responsibility,” to equal pay for “substantially similar work.”  The amendment also eliminates the requirement that the work be performed at the “same establishment” to demonstrate a wage gap.

Have a Strong and Current Employee Handbook in Place

It’s important for manufacturing firms to not only understand federal and state laws that apply to them but to also have clear policies and an up-to-date employee handbook to help ensure compliance and minimize the potential of an employment practices lawsuit. 

The Need for Employment Practices Liability Insurance

In addition, be sure you have Employment Practices Liability Insurance (EPLI) in place to protect your manufacturing firm in the event of an employee lawsuit alleging discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination and other covered claims. Why is this coverage so important? Just look at the statistics: According to a study conducted by a national insurer, businesses throughout the country with at least 10 employees have a 12.5% chance of having an employment liability charge filed against it. But in California this statistic is much higher, according to the survey. In fact, the Golden State has the most frequent incidences of employment practices charges in the country, with a 42% greater chance over the national average of being sued by an employee for establishments with at least 10 employees!

Precision Manufacturing Insurance Services (PMIS) specializes in protecting the manufacturing industry in California. We’re well versed in state and federal labor laws and can help you with creating a strong employee handbook as well as provide you with the EPLI coverage you need in the event of a lawsuit.

This includes an employer’s estimated payrolls (as well as class codes) at the beginning of the policy period for the upcoming year on which the insurance carrier charges a premium using prescribed rates. After the close of the policy year, the insurance carrier looks to firm up the numbers to confirm collection of the actual premium earned for the actual exposure insured, a process that involves a premium audit. Unfortunately, some employers are surprised to find out what’s actually included in payroll remuneration (all of the various items that are considered part of an employee’s payroll) – such as income or benefits that go beyond just an employee’s salary.

Precision Manufacturing Insurance Services (PMIS) is committed to assisting manufacturing clients in understanding what drives their California Workers’ Compensation premium in addition to helping them avert any unexpected surprises during a comp audit. Following is a list of what is and isn’t included in payroll remuneration when determining your manufacturing Workers’ Compensation insurance coverage:

Included in Payroll Remuneration

-    Gross Wages
-    Salaries
-    Commissions
-    All Bonuses
-    Most Profit Sharing
-    Vacation, Holiday and Sick Pay
-    Overtime (“straight time” portion only)
-    Market Value of Gifts
-    Automobile Allowances (less reimbursement for documented expenses)

Insurance carriers have the right to audit a policy at least every three years; some policies are audited several times a year. During an audit, you must provide copies of canceled checks, payroll data, general ledgers and other financial information. The California State Workers’ Compensation Board, known as the WCIRB, can penalize an employer for not maintaining accurate and adequate records.

Of course, failing to secure Workers’ Compensation coverage is a criminal offense. Section 3700.5 of the California Labor Code makes it a misdemeanor punishable by either a fine of not less than $10,000 or imprisonment in county jail for up to one year or both. Additionally, the state issues penalties of up to $100,000 against illegally uninsured employers. If an employee gets hurt or sick because of work and there is no Comp coverage, the employer is responsible for paying all bills related to the injury or illness.

Preparing for an Audit

To prepare for a Workers’ Compensation premium audit, we recommend taking the following steps:


-    Prior to the premium auditor arriving, decide who at the shop will be the primary contact person for the auditor. This contact person should be someone who is very familiar with the work done by all departments and all employees, as well as someone familiar with the payroll records the auditor will be reviewing.

-    Review the original policy to see how the initial estimated premium was calculated. Look at the classification codes, rates, and payrolls used to compute your initial premiums – the auditor will be starting from this as well, but will not necessarily be limited to using only the classifications listed on the policy.

-    Take a look at the information about your manufacturing firm that is readily available to the auditor, such as your company website and other online information. Remember, it is likely the auditor will be looking at this information in advance of his or her visit to your office. If there is any information there that could be misleading or is out of date regarding your operations or the nature of your work, not only should you correct it, you should also be prepared to clarify the changes with the auditor.

-    A premium auditor may also ask for information about the specific job duties performed by a certain department or by individual employees. Typically it’s to an employer’s advantage to provide accurate and detailed information to the auditor, because if the auditor has to make assumptions about the exposures he or she may well make worst-case assumptions that unnecessarily increase your premium.

PMIS can provide you with competitive Workers’ Compensation insurance and can help you by reviewing your current insurance policies, your experience modification worksheet, payroll audits, and loss-sensitive rating adjustments, to see where we can make improvements and where there have been undiagnosed problems or miscalculations.

439,KTQD7mUWoHE,Anti-Harassment Policy,"From inappropriate emails to off-the-cuff, seemingly innocuous statements to blatant sexual overtures aimed at employees by supervisors, colleagues or non-employees, workplace harassment charges continue to be among the top allegations against employers. One survey in fact reported that one in three women between the ages of 18 and 34 have been harassed at work. Furthermore, reports show that increasingly more men are alleging sexual harassment in the workplace. Sexual harassment, according to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), at work is defined as “unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature that explicitly or implicitly affect an individual’s employment, unreasonably interferes with an individual’s work performance; or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.” For many, that definition is so broad that when it comes down to specific behaviors, some people may not realize that some of their actions fall within the definition of sexual harassment.
The Cost of Sexual Harassment in the Workplace

Sexual harassment allegations cost employers in a number of ways, including increased absenteeism. Studies show that harassment victims are more likely to miss workdays because they are either too afraid to face their harassers or because the work environment is too stressful. There is also lower productivity as a result of the harassment – when workers are feeling stressed and distracted by harassment, the quality and quantity of their work decreases. You have lower employee morale and more job turnover if the work environment is hostile.

Moreover, these allegations can be quite costly for companies when litigation is involved: On average, the cost of settling a civil sexual harassment lawsuit ranges from four to five figures – and in some cases runs into the hundreds of thousands of dollars (and, of course, into the millions for large corporations).

Harassment Prevention

To minimize the risk of incidents in your shop, manufacturers throughout California must have a rigorous anti-harassment workplace policy in place that defines and prevents harassing behavior. State law, in fact, requires employers to take all reasonable steps to prevent harassment from occurring. If an employer has failed to take such preventive measures, that employer can be held liable for the harassment. A victim may be entitled to damages, even though no employment opportunity has been denied and there is no actual loss of pay or benefits.

Your harassment policy should designate a system for reporting complaints as well as let employees know that you will respond to any complaints of sexual harassment with prompt and immediate action. In addition, by law, the following provisions should be included in your policy:


-    List all protected categories;
-    Explain the law prohibits harassment and discrimination by supervisors, managers, coworkers, and third parties;
-    Establish a complaint procedure;
-    Indicate all complaints will be fairly, timely, and thoroughly investigated; all parties are accorded appropriate due process; and conclusions are based on the evidence collected;
-    State the employer will keep complaints and investigations confidential to the extent possible but do not indicate investigations will be completely confidential;
-    Provide appropriate remedial measures and resolutions will be taken if misconduct is found; and
-    Ensure the employer will not retaliate against an employee for filing a complaint or participating in an investigation.

Within the policy, the complaint procedure must specify the following:


-    Investigations will be conducted in a timely manner by an impartial qualified person;
-    Appropriate options for remedial actions and resolutions;
-    There will be a timely response and resolution to the investigation;
-    The employer will document and track the complaint’s progress; and
-    An employee may file a complaint with someone other than his or her direct supervisor (e.g. Human Resources Manager or company hotline)

Employers with 50 or more employees must provide at least two hours of classroom or other effective interactive training and education regarding sexual harassment to all supervisory employees once every two years, and to all new supervisory employees within six months of assuming a supervisory position.

Precision Manufacturing Insurance Services (PMIS), specialists in insuring manufacturing firms throughout California, can assist you with your harassment policies, provide harassment prevention training tailored to manufacturing firms, and secure the EPLI coverage you need in the event of an allegation involving harassment and other workplace-related issues.

440,7CLt905T_,Workers' Compensation Premiums,"Workers’ Compensation insurance is one of the biggest expenses for businesses, particularly in industries with huge payrolls and high risks such as manufacturing. As a result, manufacturers are continually looking at viable solutions to reduce their Comp costs. 

Let’s take a look inside how Workers’ Comp premiums are established to understand what can be done to help reduce them. There are three factors that go into setting Workers’ Comp premiums: employee job classifications, the size of an employer’s payroll, and a company’s claims experience (experience modification factor).

Job Classifications

Every state has a manual that includes class codes for each industry and job duty. Classification criteria starts with the industry, and is further broken down into specific businesses within that industry, and even further into job duties within that business. These codes are designed to account for risk, and there is a direct relationship between the codes and the premium charged by the insurance company. Data, for example, may indicate that employees working under one code are more inclined to get hurt than those falling under a different code, and therefore the Workers’ Comp claims would be higher as well as the premium. Additionally, if an employee is misclassified the rate differential can be significant and you may end up overpaying.

This is an area that should be examined closely. Having a spreadsheet with a list of employees and corresponding codes is helpful, and looking at all employee classifications including multiple sub-classifications is invaluable – this is something that the manufacturing insurance experts at Precision Manufacturing Insurance Services (PMIS) can do for you. 

Employer Payroll

The basis for your Workers’ Comp insurance premium is your payroll. For each $100 dollars of your payroll, there is a specific rate, which is determined by the classification codes of your employees. Making sure your Workers’ Comp payroll figures are accurate is important, as there may be a difference between actual payrolls and Workers’ Comp payrolls. This is because Workers’ Comp premiums are typically calculated on an annual basis and will be quoted as an Estimated Annual Premium (EAP). The premium is estimated because at year-end, the insurer will conduct an audit and either apply a credit, issue a refund or ask for an additional premium if payroll is underreported. As specialists in providing Workers’ Compensation insurance for manufacturers, we can review your payroll audits for accuracy and for any potential problems. 

The Experience Modification Factor

After calculating your base rate (payroll per $100 X classification rate), the insurance company will calculate your experience modification factor to determine your Worker’s Comp premium (payroll per $100 X classification rate X experience modification). The ex mod is unique to each employer and is expressed as a percentage that pertains to whether your loss history is below or above other employers within the same industry. Basically, the experience mod functions as an indicator that gauges the “health” of your manufacturing company.

The Workers’ Compensation Insurance Rating Bureau of California (WCIRB) calculates the experience mods. The WCIRB uses your actual loss history as it has been reported to the Workers’ Comp insurance company. If you fall within the average range as compared to similar-size companies within your industry classification, you would typically get an experience mod of 100 and would be charged the full base rate. On the other hand, if your business has an experience mod factor of 92, you might see an 8% savings, while a business with a factor of 133 would pay 33% more. As you can see, ex mods have a direct impact on premium rates and create a powerful incentive for each company to work to reduce workplace accidents and manage claims with a company-wide safety program and comprehensive accident claims processing and investigation.

There’s a lot to digest here and we would be happy to go over in more detail the factors that affect your Workers’ Compensation premium and the steps it takes to mitigate claims, reduce costs and lower premiums. In future articles, we will also be reviewing additional ways of reducing your Comp costs, including the importance of reporting injuries within a specific timeframe, effective employee communications, accommodating employee restrictions with alternate-duty assignments, combating fraud, and much more.

441,iMlnLJp08TU,Top Reasons to Offer Comprehensive Employee Benefits,"The majority of manufacturers as with all employers are struggling to provide employees with a competitive, comprehensive benefit package. Rising medical costs, the high cost of prescription drugs, and increased health care premiums are forcing companies into a delicate balancing act of providing competitive benefits while also managing costs effectively and complying with regulations. However, even in the face of these challenges there are compelling reasons to provide employees with comprehensive employee benefits.

One of the most obvious reasons in coming up with a benefits package that makes sense for both your shop and employees is to keep good workers from jumping ship as well as to attract new talent. Many small to midsize business owners mistakenly believe they cannot afford to offer quality benefits. But while going without a good benefits package may add to your bottom line in the short run, it could impede the future growth of your firm long term. Retaining and attracting top talent is key, especially in today’s environment where the need for highly skilled workers will help firms leverage the next revolution in manufacturing and the digitization of industrial processes (think additive manufacturing, for example). Candidates with the right skills can be more selective about where they work. This means that when it comes to securing qualified employees that are highly skilled, dedicated, and will bring strength to your shop, differentiating yourself from others is imperative to remain competitive. A strong benefits package will help to attract high-quality employees and can be a crucial factor for potential candidates in deciding whether to join a company.

Furthermore, there are certain benefits good employees feel they must have to join and stay with a firm. Topping the list of must-have benefits is health insurance, but many employees are looking for disability insurance, life insurance, retirement plans, and voluntary benefits that meet their specific needs. In providing employees the benefits they value, it only stands to reason that they will be more satisfied, miss fewer workdays, be less likely to quit, and have a higher commitment to meeting the company’s goals. In fact, research shows that when employees feel their benefits needs are satisfied, they’re more productive.

A well-designed benefits program doesn’t have to break the bank. Many employees to obtain the benefits they want are ready to put more skin in the game, especially for certain voluntary benefits. They understand that they’ll have to pay for some of what they’re getting. The key is to give them options that are meaningful, and to work with an employee benefits specialist in the manufacturing industry that can structure a plan that strikes the right balance between employee needs and a firm’s budgetary parameters.

A competitive employee benefits package has the power not only to attract the best, but also to retain the best. Manufacturers who value their staff today will be those that benefit tomorrow. At Precision Manufacturing Insurance Services (PMIS), we can provide you with competitive benefits solutions for your employees. In addition to our portfolio of products, we have created the Precision Manufacturing Benefits Trust (PMBT), which unites precision manufacturers into a benefits pool in order to maximize buying power and lower rates. We welcome the opportunity to discuss how the program works and the competitive package we can create for you to offer your employees. Give us a call at (855) 910-5788.",manufacturing
442,OfiJKw5cE4,,"The manufacturing industry has experienced several seismic changes throughout its history: from the use of machines powered by water and steam during the 18th century to mass production lines powered by electric energy at the start of the 20th century, to the shift that took place from analog and mechanical production to electronic and digital technology from the 1970s to recent years. Now we’re entering what’s being coined as Industry 4.0 (or the Internet of Everything) in manufacturing with emerging changes that have the strong potential to revolutionize the way factories work. What is Industry 4.0 and how will these changes affect American manufacturers?

Industry 4.0 is defined as the next phase in the digitization of the manufacturing sector, which is driven by four disruptions. This includes the rise in data volumes, computational power, and connectivity, especially new low-power wide-area networks; the emergence of analytics and business-intelligence capabilities (what’s called Big Data); new forms of human-machine interaction such as touch interfaces and augmented-reality systems; and improvements in transferring digital instructions to the physical world, such as advanced robotics and 3-D printing. In a nutshell, Industry 4.0 uses smart technology and real-time data to increase productivity and reduce costs.

In fact, Industry 4.0 is being embraced worldwide, including here at home. In the United States, a non-profit organization, Smart Manufacturing Leadership Coalition (SMLC), has been set up and is comprised of manufacturers, suppliers, technology firms, government agencies, universities and laboratories with the common goal of advancing the way of thinking behind Industry 4.0. The goal is to construct an open, smart manufacturing platform for industrial-networked information applications, with the hope that manufacturing firms of all sizes will have affordable access to modeling and analytical technologies that can be customized to meet their needs.

The opportunities Industry 4.0 offers are many including increased competitiveness, the ability for flexible customer integration, and a boost in quality and efficiency (for example, analyzing machine data to avoid defects in the production process and the capability to carry out predictive maintenance). Of course, there are risks, too.  The “Internet of Everything” – services, data and people – also opens up new avenues for cyber threats, including industrial espionage and attacks by hackers. These risks must be managed through tailored risk management and an appropriate security strategy.

Resources must also be contemplated for companies facing the digital transformation to Industry 4.0, including the appropriateness of a manufacturer’s existing IT infrastructure and the availability of the necessary talent and skilled employees. According to a study by Deloitte, “Industry 4.0 requires existing installations to be adapted and, in some cases, entirely new types of IT infrastructure. Diverse systems need to be networked and to learn to communicate with each other, and new communications networks need to be developed from scratch. A range of systems in differing business segments, such as research and development, procurement and purchasing, production, warehousing and logistics, marketing, sales and services, need to be taken into consideration with regard to networking. This will be a major challenge for manufacturing companies, although the priorities set by differing business segments in relation to the digital transformation to Industry 4.0 will vary.”

Moreover, digitization increases the importance of new technical skills, particularly in the case of operating activities and mechanical working processes in production, purchasing, warehousing and logistics. 

Some of the Industry 4.0 technologies are not yet applicable to scale, but they will be in time, and companies and their industrial processes need to adapt to this rapid change if they are not to be left behind by developments in their sector and by their competitors. The key is for manufacturers to monitor these upcoming changes and develop strategies to take advantage of the new opportunities. 

In upcoming articles, we will be taking a look at some key technologies transforming the future of manufacturing, including 3-D printing.  Precision Manufacturing Insurance Services (PMIS) is committed to helping the manufacturing sector continue to be a driving force in the American business landscape. We do this by providing industry-specific risk management and insurance solutions that positively affect your bottom line. We also are committed to keeping you updated on the emerging trends that directly affect your business. For more information about PMIS, contact us at (855) 910 - 5788.

WIKIPEDIA:
Antonio Lucio Vivaldi, nicknamed il Prete Rosso because of his red hair, was an Italian Baroque composer, Catholic priest, and virtuoso violinist, born in Venice.
The Four Seasons (Italian: Le quattro stagioni) is a set of four violin concertos by Antonio Vivaldi. Composed in 1723, The Four Seasons is Vivaldi's best-known work, and is among the most popular pieces of baroque music. The texture of each concerto is varied, each resembling its respective season. For example, ""Winter"" is peppered with silvery pizzicato notes from the high strings, calling to mind icy rain, whereas ""Summer"" evokes a thunderstorm in its final movement, which is why the movement is often dubbed ""Storm"".

It didn't matter how many times I got knocked on the floor

Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing if your heart didn't dream with me
Where would I be, if you didn't believe
Believe...

There were days when out you spoken, you know
There were night when I was doubting myself
But your kept my heart from falling
It didn't matter how many times I got knocked on the floor
But you knew one day I would be standing tall
Just look at us now
Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing if your heart didn't dream with me
Where would I be, if you didn't believe

Where would I be, if you, if you

531,STTMyQ1NH3E,Exhibition of Rejects,"Why it's better to be a reject.  Are YOU?

The Salon des Refusés, French for ""exhibition of rejects"" (French pronunciation: [salɔ̃ de ʁəfyze]), is generally an exhibition of works rejected by the jury of the official Paris Salon, but the term is most famously used to refer to the Salon des Refusés of 1863.

The glamorous event of 1863 was actually sponsored by the French government. In that year, artists protested the Salon jury's rejection of more than 3,000 works, far more than usual. ""Wishing to let the public judge the legitimacy of these complaints,"" said an official notice, Emperor Napoléon III decreed that the rejected artists could exhibit their works in an annex to the regular Salon. Many critics and the public ridiculed the refusés, which included such now-famous paintings as Édouard Manet's Luncheon on the Grass (Le déjeuner sur l'herbe) [1] and James McNeill Whistler's Symphony in White, No. 1: The White Girl. But the critical attention also legitimized the emerging avant-garde in painting. The Impressionists successfully exhibited their works outside the Salon beginning in 1874.

532,I75ZhzyPDL,Impressionism,"Impressionism is a 19th-century art movement that originated with a group of Paris-based artists. Their independent exhibitions brought them to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s, in spite of harsh opposition from the conventional art community in France. The name of the style derives from the title of a Claude Monet work, Impression, soleil levant (Impression, Sunrise), which provoked the critic Louis Leroy to coin the term in a satiric review published in the Parisian newspaper Le Charivari.

Impressionist painting characteristics include

Relatively small, thin, yet visible brush strokes
Open composition
Emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities (often accentuating the effects of the passage of time)
Common, ordinary subject matter
Inclusion of movement as a crucial element of human perception and experience
Unusual visual angles
The development of Impressionism in the visual arts was soon followed by analogous styles in other media that became known as Impressionist music and Impressionist literature.


Impressionism is a 19th century artistic movement.
In 1874, a group of artists called the Anonymous Society of Painters, Sculptors, Printmakers, etc. organized an exhibition in Paris that started the movement called Impressionism. The main man was  Claude Monet. 
The first impressionistic exhibit had critical reviews from arts critics. Cezanne and Monet received the harshest reviews by art critic Louis Leroy.  Le Charivari newspaper published the art critic's  review and used the word ""Impressionist"" from Claude Monet's painting entitled Impression Sunrise (Impression, Soleil Levant) to derisively describe the artists whose works he considered as being no more than unfinished sketches.  He scathingly wrote:
Impression—I was certain of it. I was just telling myself that, since I was impressed, there had to be some impression in it ... and what freedom, what ease of workmanship! Wallpaper in its embryonic state is more finished than that seascape.

Little that Leroy knew that by bashing Claude Monet's Impression, Sunrise (Musée Marmottan Monet, Paris)- he would gave the Impressionist movement its name. Remember Leroy accused it of being a sketch or ""impression,"" not a finished painting. haha! In your face leroy!


btw 
In addition to their radical technique, the bright colors of Impressionist canvases were shocking for eyes accustomed to the more sober colors of Academic painting.
